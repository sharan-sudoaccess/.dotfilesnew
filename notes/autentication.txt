1.2A BYPASS BY URL PATH CHANGING
  1.step up two account usr1 ,usr2
  2.log in via usr1 by completing 2A verification in process ...see path changes like /login_2a_verification to /my-account?id=usr1 
  3.in login panel enetr usr2 and passwd ,in 2A verification phase ..try to modify or change url to final path (/myaccount?id=usr2)
  #4.REMEMBER IT IS NOT ONLY ABT THE URL PATH SOMETIMES FAILURE TO CHECK THE TOKEN BELONGS TO WHICH USR...CHK ALL POSSIBLE PARAMETER THAT CHLS FOR AUTENTICATION OR AUTHORISATION

2.PASSWORD REST BROKEN LOGIC.
  
  1.Backend sends the reset link for email
  2.User click that link and see new_pass and conform_pass
  3.In POST request temp-token is created for this process and autosetting username=usr &new_pass=xxx&conform_pass=xxx in POST request in body.
  4.If changing the usr name parameter  username=usr2 changes passwd for usr,it means it is not checking for whose token it is ..likely because developer things that rest link is going to certian user's email   
   
   So backend logic becomes:
         if token is valid:
            reset password for submitted username
   instead of 
         user = lookup_user_by_token(token)
         reset password for user
   ACCORDING TO ME ..IT COMES UNDER AUTHORISATION BUT OWSAP CLASSIFIED IT AS AUTENTICATION.
